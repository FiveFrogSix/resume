    "present": "Hello, my nickname is Beam. I've been working as a Web Developer for about 3 years. Currently, Iâ€™m a Fullstack developer, though I primarily focus on Frontend work. I also handle some Backend tasks using PHP (with Laravel in certain parts) and Golang (Gin framework). On the Frontend, I mostly work with Vue3 and Vite, though I occasionally deal with older projects that use PHP and JavaScript. I prefer Frontend development over Backend, but I'm capable of doing both, with a stronger proficiency in Frontend.",
